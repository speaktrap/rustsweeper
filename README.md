# Minesweeper for Rust

Too bad I didn't upload this code to GitHub sooner. It was a great idea to learn Rust with this game, as I tried many methods on the way.
At the beginning I tried to use as many functions as I can, passing main array with pointers like a hot potato.
I realized it's not only needless, but just too hard for me. I still have no idea how to make map resizable in runtime without resorting to implementing everything in fn main().
I still don't know if I hate or love Rust.
